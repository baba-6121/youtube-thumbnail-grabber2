        <h2 class="section-title">🎯 Size usage by context (Contextual breakdown)</h2>

        <h3>A. Standard YouTube video thumbnails</h3>
        <p>
          For regular horizontal videos, always use a <strong>1280 x 720 pixel</strong> thumbnail with a <strong>16:9</strong> aspect ratio.
          This size keeps your thumbnail sharp while loading quickly on most devices.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>On desktop: thumbnails are usually displayed in 16:9 so small details remain clear.</li>
          <li>On mobile: thumbnails are scaled down, so keep your main title text large and readable.</li>
          <li>On TV: resolution is higher, so avoid visible compression artifacts.</li>
          <li>Leave safe margins on the left and right so avatars, time badges and the progress bar don't cover important content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. YouTube Shorts covers</h3>
        <p>
          Shorts covers are usually generated from frames in your video, but you can still upload a custom <strong>16:9 (1280 x 720)</strong> thumbnail to keep things consistent.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the feed, the cover is cropped to a ratio close to <strong>4:5</strong>.</li>
          <li>In the Shorts player, the cover is compressed into a small vertically centered area.</li>
          <li>Place the most important elements (headline, face, logo) in the central area of the image.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C. Extra size reference: YouTube channel art (channel banner)</h3>
        <p>Channel art is not technically a thumbnail, but people often search for these sizes at the same time.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Recommended size:</strong> 2560 x 1440 pixels</li>
          <li><strong>Safe area:</strong> 2560 x 423 pixels (keep text and logos inside this area so they stay visible on all devices).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">🎨 Thumbnail design &amp; SEO tips</h2>

        <h3>5 design principles to improve click-through rate</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>High contrast:</strong> use strong contrast between text and background so it stays readable when shrunk.</li>
          <li><strong>Face close-ups:</strong> if you appear on camera, highlight facial expressions and emotion.</li>
          <li><strong>Brand elements:</strong> keep your logo or channel name in a consistent position.</li>
          <li><strong>Short text:</strong> keep copy under about 6 words and use large, bold fonts.</li>
          <li><strong>Visual punch:</strong> use saturated colors and clear composition to guide the viewer's eye.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h3>Optimize thumbnail filenames for SEO</h3>
        <p>
          Before you upload, rename the file to a descriptive name that includes your main keyword, for example:
          <code>youtube-thumbnail-size-guide-1280x720.jpg</code>.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2 class="section-title">❓ Frequently asked questions (FAQ section)</h2>

        <h3>Q1: Why does YouTube recommend 1280x720 instead of 1920x1080?</h3>
        <p>
          1280x720 is the 720p HD standard. It offers a good balance between sharpness and file size,
          so thumbnails load quickly while still looking crisp on most screens.
        </p>

        <h3>Q2: If I don't upload a custom thumbnail, what will YouTube use?</h3>
        <p>
          If you don't upload a custom thumbnail, YouTube automatically picks three frames from your video for you to choose from.
          These auto-selected frames rarely express the core idea of your content, so it's strongly recommended to upload a designed thumbnail.
        </p>

        <h3>Q3: Can I use a GIF as my thumbnail?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, but it will be displayed as a static image, not an animation.
          If you want a sense of motion, rely on strong facial expressions or bold contrasting colors in a still image instead.
        </p>
